* DONE Results
* DONE Discussion
- Design Discussion
  - New challenges
- Discuss results
  - Got I->J system working. Time permited us from getting I->JN system working
  - Generated data Results showed that there were significant performance gains given sufficient correlation
  - Performance gains marginal for lower correlation
  - Generated data results were consistent with results on images
  - Measured correlation between stereoscopic images was lower than minimum performance threshold
  - Consistent with visual results. No visual benefits over I->I system
  - Large benefits when the same image was at both encoders. Also consistent with generated data results.
- Discuss improvements that could be made
  - I->JN system
  - Quantizer parameters
  - Further gains could be achieved
  - Bit Allocation
  - different image types
  - Is DCT best transform for I->J system?
