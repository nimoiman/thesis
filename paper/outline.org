* Results
* Discussion
- Discuss results
    - Got I->J system working. Time permited us from getting I->JN system working
    - Generated data Results showed that there were significant performance gains given sufficient correlation
    - Performance gains marginal for lower correlation
    - Generated data results were consistent with results on images
    - Measured correlation between stereoscopic images was lower than minimum performance threshold
    - Consistent with visual results. No visual benefits over I->I system
    - Large benefits when the same image was at both encoders. Also consistent with generated data results.
- Discuss improvements that c
