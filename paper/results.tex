\section{Results}
The results of our simulations are twofold. We firstly ran Gaussian training and simulation sets through our \sysII, \sysIJ, \sysJJ\ systems, using Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to compare the performances of the three systems, we likewise do the same with our \sysIIN, \sysIJN, \sysJJN\ systems. We then make comparisons between performaces of the systems on the class of steroscopic images, and present the resulting Signal-to-Noise ratios and images.
\subsection{Generated Data}
As was mentioned in the previous section, Gaussian data provides a good model for the constant DCT coefficient of images. It is therefore appropriate to measure the performance of the system on this idealized case before working with actual image sets.
