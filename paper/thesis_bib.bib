@article{favardin,
	Abstract = {Several issues related to vector quantization for noisy channels are discussed. An algorithm based on simulated annealing is developed for assigning binary codewords to the vector quantizer code-vectors. It is shown that this algorithm could result in dramatic performance improvements as compared to randomly selected codewords. A modification of the simulated annealing algorithm for binary codeword assignment is developed for the case where the bits in the codeword are subjected to unequal error probabilities (resulting from unequal levels of error protection). An algorithm for the design of an optimal vector quantizer for a noisy channel is briefly discussed, and its robustness under channel mismatch conditions is studied. Numerical results for a stationary first-order Gauss-Markov source and a binary symmetric channel are provided. It is concluded that the channel-optimized vector quantizer design algorithm, if used carefully, can result in a fairly robust system with no additional delay. The case in which the communication channel is nonstationary (as in mobile radio channels) is studied, and some preliminary ideas for quantizer design are presented},

@article{Gray:1984,
	Abstract = {A vector quantizer is a system for mapping a sequence of continuous or discrete vectors into a digital sequence suitable for communication over or storage in a digital channel. The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors, images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article to survey some of these design techniques and their applications.},
