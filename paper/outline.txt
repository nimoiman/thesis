    Conclusion
        Complexity
            Depends more on bin size than training set size

Testing and Results
    (Focus more on method than discussion of results)
    Testing overview
        Training and Simulation set
        Measure distortion vs. Theoretical distortion
        Compare images visually
        Want to compare vs independent decoder and joint encoders
    Generated data 

    Images
        Using optimal bit allocation

Discussion
    Discuss results
        Compare vs independent decoder and joint encoder

Conclusion
    Further work
